## Simulate data with 5 topologies (gt) and 3 pacemakers (pm) for each topology

In this simulation the number of genes is 510. Bootstrapping to find the optimal number of clusters from 2:50 is taking 24 seconds with 5 cores.

   - Can we recover the true number of gt clusters?

   **Fig 1. Average silhouette width for numbers of gt clusters**

 According to the silhouette with, the number of gts is 5, corresponding to the number of gts used to generate the data.

The clustering algorithm classifies the trees correctly. (this is in the mds_clustering script).

The distance between the mediods and the true gts is:


   ** To do** 

   Does the medoid correspond to the true tree? What about the concatenated data?
